## About

Sistem Informasi Smanda is a mobile application developed using Flutter, designed to provide students of Smanda (a hypothetical school) with essential information and resources. This app aims to streamline access to school announcements, schedules, grades, and other important information, improving communication and overall student experience.

The app addresses the common challenges students face in accessing timely and relevant school-related information. By centralizing these resources into a user-friendly mobile application, Sistem Informasi Smanda enhances efficiency and accessibility. The target audience is primarily students of Smanda, but also includes teachers and parents who may benefit from certain features.

Built using Flutter, the application leverages Dart for its programming language. The architecture follows a standard Flutter design pattern, utilizing widgets for UI components and state management techniques to handle data flow and updates. The backend infrastructure (if any) would involve APIs for fetching and updating data, potentially using services like Firebase or a custom-built server.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **School Announcements**: Stay updated with the latest news and announcements from Smanda.
- 📅 **Class Schedules**: View your personalized class schedule with ease.
- 💯 **Grades & Performance**: Access your grades and academic performance reports.
- 📱 **Mobile-Friendly**: Designed for seamless use on iOS and Android devices.
- 🎨 **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive and easy-to-navigate design.
- 🛠️ **Customizable Notifications**: Tailor notifications to receive relevant updates.
